Getting started
===============

If you are experiencing an issue while setting up this project, please take a look at the [Common issues](common_issues.md) section of the documentation. If you cannot find a solution to your problem there, please [create a ticket](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-ecommerce-platform/issues/new) explaining the issue that you are experiencing and the steps to reproduce it.

## Setup the development environment

To set up the development environment, you will need to install __pyenv__ on your computer. You can find installation instruction at [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation). Please make sure that you have the [required tools and libraries](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems) installed in your environment. If you're using [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) with Amazon Linux 2, you can use `make setup-cloud9` to install all necessary tools.

When __pyenv__ is installed, you can run `make setup` to configure the Python environment for this project, including development tools and dependencies.

You will also need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12 or greater, [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and __md5sum__. __md5sum__ is not available by default on MacOS but can be installed through the [coreutils formula in homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils).

## Deploy the infrastructure on AWS

If you want to deploy the entire project into your AWS account in a dev environment, you can run the command `make all` in the [root](../) of this project. Please note that this will create an S3 bucket to store artifacts as part of the packaging step.

If you want to deploy only a specific service and its dependencies, you can use the command `make deps-${SERVICE}`.

These commands will lint, build, run unit tests, package, deploy and run integration tests on the services.

### Deploy the production pipeline

If you want to deploy a complete pipeline to a production environment, you can run `make bootstrap-pipeline`, which will deploy all services in all environments needed by the pipeline, the CI/CD pipeline itself and seed a CodeCommit repository with the latest commit from this repository.

When you want to push modifications to AWS, you can run `git push aws HEAD:main`, which will push the latest commit from the current branch to the main branch in the CodeCommit repository.

## Useful commands

All the following commands can be run without the service name (e.g. `make tests-integ` to run integration tests for all services).

* __`make ci-${SERVICE}`__ (e.g. make ci-products): lint, build and run unit tests for a specific service.
* __`make all-${SERVICE}`__ (e.g. make all-orders): lint, build, run unit tests, package, deploy to AWS and run integration tests for a specific service.
* __`make tests-unit-${SERVICE}`__: run unit tests for a service, useful when you had a bug in the unit tests but don't need to rebuild the Lambda functions.
* __`make tests-integ-${SERVICE}`__: run integration tests for a service, for when you had a bug in the integration tests.
* __`make tests-e2e`__: run end-to-end tests that check if the overall ordering workflows work as expected.

## Creating or modifying a service

To read how you can create a new service or modify an existing one, please read the [service structure documentation](service_structure.md).
